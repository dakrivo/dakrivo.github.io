	This project consisted of designing and manufacturing a water ingress testing tank. This project is funded by our client REMM, a watch manufacturer. 
	The design process of our product has recently concluded, which included several design reviews with the Engineer in Residence. The multiple considerations included longevity, strength, cost, ease of manufacture of our 30+ components, supplier availibility. among many others.
	As team leader of this project, my role has been to divide the project into tasks and assign them based on individual knowledge and expertise. I assigned tasks based on dependencies as well such that our team could make concurrent progress, succesfully 
	achieving our desired results in time for each deadline. My specific responsibilities for the project included the design of the pneumatic pump system, as well as the stress analysis and FEA of the many pump components. The project is still underway, with our most
	recent deliverable being the final drawing package, which allows us to progress to the manufacturing stage.

	This project consisted of designing and prototyping a gearbox with one single input (electric motor) and three outputs of specified torques and horsepower for a textile industrial machine.
	Additionally, the gearbox had 3 selectable modes, which each disabled one of the 3 outputs. In addition to designing a very compact gearbox with a dog-clutch system which allowed the gearbox
	to change modes during operation, a comprehensive stress analysis of the system was conducted by traditional means. In order to optimize the process of stress analysis on the various shafts in our system (9), 
	I created a MATLAB progam which computed all the shear and bending diagrams, and subsequently the minimum shaft diameter along the length of the shaft, taking into account stress concentrations. 
	Additionally, I performed FEA on the gear teeth and dog clutch mechanism to ensure reliability under fatigue failure conditions to corroborate the traditional stress analysis.

	For my aerodynamics course, a term reseach project was conducted to compare various methods of computing lift and drag on an assigned 4-digit NACA airfoil. The methods compared
	were Thin Airfoil Theory, which approximates the airfoil as a flat plate and can easily be solved by hand, Vortex Panel Method, a computational method, and Finite Wing theory, a computational 
	method which includes wing tip effects in the computation of lift and drag. The methods were compared using python scripts to converge to numerical solutions. The results were also compared with XFOIL, 
	a commonly used 2D airfoil solver.

	During the COVID-19 lockdown, I found myself with too much time on my hands, and purchased a discarded BMW for 1200$. I brought the car home on a rented UHaul trailer from Gatineau, after it had sat untouched for 
	2 years.
	The next day, as I was trying to fix the car, I wondered if I may have gotten in over my head. However, after a few days of work, I was able to get the car started by repairing the clutch cylinder.
	After a summer of work, I succesfully repaired other parts of the car, replacing the transmission, clutch, updating the suspension and brakes systems with new components, as well as repairing various 
	problems, such as the fuel pump, brake lines, gas lines wheel bearings, valve cover gasket, radiator, belts, fans, pulleys, among many others. I also learned how to do bodywork, finding a spoiler at a
	scrapyard and painting it to match the red of my new (30 years old) BMW. Unfortunately, as I started university, I no longer had the time, money, or space to keep messing around with my problem car, and 
	made the difficult decision to sell it. Being that it was a classic car that was now working and looking better than ever, I was able to resell it for many times what I purchased it for.

		For this project, I was given the drawings for 4 assemblies. A hammer, a square, a keychain, and a box. After making process plans for each part that needed to be manufactured,
		I used the manual lathe and mill, as well as various hand tools, to manufacture the parts. I also used bending tools to manufacture the box, and a CNC mill to engrave the square.
