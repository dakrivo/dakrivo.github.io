	I am a soon to graduate Mechanical Engineering Student with a passion for aerospace, fluid dynamics, programming, numerical methods, and much more!
	I am very ressourceful, and pride myself in solving problems. My favorite feeling is when I solve a particularly challenging problem with a clever solution. 
	I am also a very fast learner, having taught myself many programming languages. 
	Consult my project page to see some of my projects.
	I work part-time at the airport, and have lots of cool experiences, pictures, and videos from my time there. Contact me to learn more!
